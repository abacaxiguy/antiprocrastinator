## 🛠 What it does

Anti-Procrastinator checks all your open programs, and checks if a chrome tab has "<b>YouTube</b>" (in `Light Mode`) OR "<b>Instagram</b>", "<b>Twitter</b>" (in `Hard Mode`) OR even "<b>WhatsApp</b>" (in `HARDCORE Mode`)

If Anti-Procrastinator finds it, it will close all your chrome tabs <b>instantly!</b>

When you run the program, it will be in your system tray icons, and you can right-click it to show the menu
In the menu shown in the screenshots above, you can change your mode or turn it off, as well as exit the program.
